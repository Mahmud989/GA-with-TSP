# GA and TSP
Evolution of a salesman: genetic algorithm java </br>
GA to find a solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP).

# About
The genetic algorithms are useful for NP-hard problems, especially the traveling salesman problem. The genetic algorithm depends on selection criteria, crossover, and mutation operators. ... In this article, we propose a new crossover operator for traveling salesman problem to minimize the total distance.
# Goal
  This project is my one of graduation projects. Yes its working and one of problems is only netbeans and java se support. <br>You can use and change everything.
# Good luck :)
